  <p>Nashik was known by different names in different <b>Yugas</b>. According to Hindu legends, It was known as
    “Padmanagar” during <b>Satya Yuga</b>, “Trikantak” during <b>Treta Yuga</b>, “Janasthana” during <b>Dvapara
      Yuga</b>, and ultimately "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during <b>Kali Yuga</b>. During the Mughal period it was known as
    “Gulshanabad”, the city of roses. Nashik has mythological, historical, social and cultural importance. The city is
    situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world.
    According to Hindu mythology, <b>Lord Rama</b>, the King of <b>Ayodhya</b>, made Nashik his abode during his 14
    years in exile. At the same place <b>Lord Laxman</b>, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of <b>"Shurpanakha"</b>
    and thus this city was named as "Nasik" as the word Nasik means nose in Sanskrit.<br>After the fall of the
    Satavahana empire, the <b>Abhiras</b> or <b>Ahirs</b> ruled in the north east and the <b>Chutus</b> in Maharashtra
    and Kuntala. The <b>Puranas </b>state that ten Abhira tribes ruled for 67 years. The Nashik inscription speaks of
    king <b>Madhuriputra</b> Ishvarasena, the Abhir and a son of Shivadatla. This dynasty originated in A.D. 249–50, an
    era called <b>Kalachuri</b> or <b>Chedi</b> in later times.<br>Classical Sanskrit poets like <b>Valmiki</b>,
    <b>Kālidāsa</b> and<b> Bhavabhuti </b>have paid rich tributes here. In 150 BC Nashik was the country's largest
    market place. From 1487 A.D, the province came under the rule of Mughals and its name was changed Gulshanabad (No
    such proofs for this name). It was also home of<b> Emperor Akbar</b> who wrote at length about Nashik in
    Ein-e-Akbari. It was also known as the 'Land of the Brave' during the regime of Maratha Emperor <bs>
      Shivaji</b>.<br>The most important historical significance is that Kumbh Mela is conducted at Nashik once every
      twelve years, out of 4 places in India.

  <p>Nashik lies in the northern part of Maharashtra state at 584 m (1,916 ft)[10] from the mean sea level which gives
    it ideal temperature variation, particularly in winters.<br>The river Godavari originates from the Brahmagiri
    Mountain, Trimbakeshwar about 24 km (15 mi) from Nashik and flows through the old residential settlement, now in the
    central part of the city. Due to high pollution created by factories in proximity of the city the river was dying at
    an alarming rate. It has since been successfully cleaned.<br>Nashik lies on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau
    which is an ancient volcanic formation.<br>Trimbakeshwar is about 30 km (19 mi) from the city, it is where from
    river Godavari originates. The land area of the city is about 259.13 km2 (100.05 sq mi).</p>

    dry climate. Temperatures rise slightly in October, but this is followed by the cool season from November to
    February. The cool season sees warm temperatures of around 28 °C during the day, but cool nights, with lows
